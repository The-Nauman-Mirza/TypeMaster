# TypeMaster

**TypeMaster** is a simple yet powerful typing speed test app that helps you improve your typing skills by measuring words per minute (WPM), accuracy, and allowing you to track past performance. It includes a real-time countdown timer, character highlighting for correct and incorrect keystrokes, and saves the past results in your browser’s local storage.

## Features

- **Real-Time Character Highlighting**: Correct characters turn green and incorrect characters turn red as you type.
- **Countdown Timer**: A timer counts down from 60 seconds. The test stops automatically when the time runs out.
- **Typing Performance Tracking**: Shows your WPM (Words Per Minute) and typing accuracy as you type.
- **Past Results**: Tracks your past results and displays them on the app for reference. Results are stored in your browser’s local storage.
- **Responsive Design**: The app works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Test**: Click the "Start Test" button to begin the typing test. A random paragraph will be shown, and you will type in the textarea.
2. **Start Typing**: Begin typing the paragraph. The timer will start, and your typing performance (WPM and accuracy) will be displayed in real-time.
3. **View Results**: After the test ends, your WPM and accuracy will be displayed. The last 5 results will be saved and displayed below the test area.
4. **Refresh the Page**: Your past results are stored in your browser’s local storage, so you can view them even after refreshing the page.
